1.	IoT (Internet of Things):- It refers to the collective network of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. Thanks to the advent of inexpensive computer chips and high bandwidth telecommunication, we now have billions of devices connected to the internet. This means everyday devices like toothbrushes, vacuums, cars, and machines can use sensors to collect data and respond intelligently to users.
Features of IOT¬:-

•	Intelligence
•	Connectivity
•	Dynamic Nature
•	Sensing
•	Security
           Advantages of IoT:-
•	Efficient and Saves Time
•	Automation of daily tasks leads to better monitoring of devices
•	Better Quality of Life 
          Disadvantage of Iot:-
•	Technology Takes Control of Life
•	Privacy/Security
•	Privacy/Security

2.	IoT Based Home Design:- The concept of Home Automation aims to bring the control of operating your everyday home electrical appliances to the tip of your finger, thus giving user affordable lighting solutions, better energy conservation with optimum use of energy. Apart from just lighting solutions, the concept also further extends to have a overall control over your home security as well as build a centralized home entertainment system and much more. 

3.	The IoT based Home Automation system offer a lot of flexibility over the wired systems s it comes with various advantages like ease-of-use, ease-of-installation, avoid complexity of running through wires or loose electrical connections, easy fault detection and triggering and above and all it even offers easy mobility.

4.	Motion Detector:- A motion detector is an electrical device that utilizes a sensor to detect nearby motion. Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. They form a vital component of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency, and other useful systems.

5.	A motion detector may be among the sensors of a burglar alarm that is used to alert the home owner or security service when it detects the motion of a possible intruder. Such a detector may also trigger a security camera to record the possible intrusion.

6.	Fire /Smoke Detector:- A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Household smoke detectors, also known as smoke alarms, generally issue an audible or visual alarm from the detector itself or several detectors if there are multiple devices interlinked. Household smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units to several interlinked units with battery backup. With interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, alarms will trigger at all of the units.
